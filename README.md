# LiNGAM-Polytree-Learning

This folder contains the R files necessary to run the algorithms described in the paper "Learning Linear Non-Gaussian Polytree Models".
In particular the file "Functions.R" contains the library needed to run the algorithms and the functions that implement the algorithms, while tha file "Simulation.R" contain the procedure to test the algorithms on simulated data.
